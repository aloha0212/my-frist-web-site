    target="-blank" title="html5 specifcation">Hypertext markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications. This study examines the effects of corpus-based learning of vocabulary and grammar according to proficiency level and surveys the Korean high-school students attitudes toward corpus-ba sed language learning. A total of 100 students participated in a three-week session of either corpus-based learning or traditional instruction, followed by two post-tests. Those who experienced corpus-based learning also answered the attitude-questionnaire. The main findings of the study are as follows.

  </P><p style="magin-top:45px;"> (1) Corpus-based vocabulary learning was more effective than traditional instruction with high-level students. (2) For both high- and low-level students, there was no significant difference in the effects of grammar learning between corpus-based and traditional instruction. (3) The high-level students were more positive about corpus-based language learning than the low-level students, but in general, the students showed favorable attitudes towards the corpus-based language learning. The paper discusses the findings and concludes with some pedagogical implications and suggestions for future research.</p>
